**Multimodal algorithms for H&amp;E comprehension**

We developed an algorithm for classifying and segmenting H&E stained images and tested its capabilities on a simple breast cancer dataset. The algorithm incorporates textual content as an aid, showing commendable performance in the classification tasks. After achieving more precise classifications, the algorithm also excels in segmentation tasks. In the future, we will focus on incorporating more semantic information into the segmentation tasks. It is worth noting that more detailed textual content is not necessarily better; we have observed that providing only the core information in the text significantly enhances the classification tasks. As for how to define the core information in the text, we are still exploring this aspect.
